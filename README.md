## This is a task manager app that helps its users complete more tasks.

First of all, the user can manage their tasks (temporary things, like homework or assignments) and routine (sleep, extracurriculars, etc). Secondly, there is a calendar that shows the current date and highlights the current time. Thirdly, there is a chat where the user can talk to an AI bot which provides support and can entertain them.

The AI model could be found in branch ChatBot.

### Future improvements
- Figure out how to run python script using Java;
- Include the responce from AI into chat interface; 
- The calander currently displays the tasks for one day. Increase the number to a week.
