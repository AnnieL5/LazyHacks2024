Here's a possible schedule:

**Option 1 (Consecutive):**

* 9:00 AM - 9:20 AM: Read (20 mins)
* 9:20 AM - 9:50 AM: Practice problems (30 mins)


**Option 2 (With a Break):**

* 9:00 AM - 9:20 AM: Read (20 mins)
* 9:20 AM - 9:25 AM: Short Break (5 mins)
* 9:25 AM - 9:55 AM: Practice problems (30 mins)


The best option depends on your personal preferences and energy levels.  If you need a break to switch gears, Option 2 might be better.  If you prefer to focus intensely on one task after another, Option 1 might work well.
